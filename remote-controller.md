Remote Controller
-----------------

**Remote Controller** SmartApp allows using remote controls, such as [Aeon Labs
Minimote](http://www.amazon.com/Aeon-Labs-DSA03202-v1-Minimote/dp/B00KU7ERAW/),
to control essential functions of the [SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com)
home automation system.

Remote Controller supports remote control with up to 99 buttons. Each button
can be individually configured to perform any (or all) of the following
actions:

* Execute [Routine](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205380034-Meet-Routines)
* Change [Mode](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/200962880-How-Do-Modes-Work-)
* Arm/Disarm [Smart Home Monitor](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205380154-Meet-Smart-Home-Monitor)

Some remote controls, for example Aeon Labs Minimote, can recognize whether
the button was pushed momentarily or held down. You can configure Remote
Controller to perform different actions depending on the type of button
action.
