## Legacy SmartThings Projects

__Please note that SmartThings Groovy-based SmartApps and device handlers will be shut down at the end of 2022. Therefore, all the projects listed here are now obsolete. Surely it was fun while it lasted :)__

This repository contains open source applications (SmartApps) and custom
device handlers I have written for the [SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com)
home automation system.
