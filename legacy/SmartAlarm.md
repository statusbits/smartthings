Smart Alarm
-----------

Smart Alarm is a versatile home security application for the
[SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com) home automation system.

__Please note that this app is provided here *as is* and is no longer supported.
Smart Alarm users are advised to switch to
[Smart Home Monitor (SHM)](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205380154),
the native home security application developed and supported by SmartThings.__

### Features

* Two arming modes - Away and Stay.
* Unlimited number of security zones (sensors) - contact, motion, movement
(acceleration), moisture or smoke.
* Each security zone can be configured as Exterior (armed in both Away and
Stay modes), Interior (armed in Away mode only), Alert (always armed) or
Bypass (never armed).
* Entry and exit delays in both Stay and Away zones. Delays can be optionally
disabled for each zone.
* When an armed security zone is tripped, Smart Alarm can turn on sirens and
switches as well as execute chosen 'Hello, Home' action.
* Smart Alarm can send you push notifications and text messages when it's
armed, disarmed or when an alarm is triggered.
* Voice notifications using compatible audio devices, e.g. Sonos.

### Arming and Disarming

Smart Alarm can be armed and disarmed in three different ways:

1. Using home *Modes*. For example, you can configure Smart Alarm to arm in
Away mode when the home Mode is set to 'Away', to arm in Stay mode when the
home Mode is set to 'Night' and to disarm when the home Mode is set to 'Home'.
Using home Modes to arm and disarm Smart Alarm is a very flexible and powerful
technique because the modes can be changed by other Smart Apps and 'Hello,
Home' actions (also known as *phrases*). For example, 'Good Night!' action
activates the 'Night' mode, thus automatically arming Smart Alarm in Stay
mode.
2. Using a remote control, such as
[Aeon Labs Minimote](http://www.amazon.com/Aeon-Labs-DSA03202-v1-Minimote/dp/B00KU7ERAW)
3. Using REST API endpoints. Smart Alarm provides REST APIs to arm, disarm
and trigger panic alarm using HTTP GET request. This feature can be used to
integrate Smart Alarm into variety of web apps and dashboards.

### Using REST API

Smart Alarm provides the following REST API endpointss to arm, disarm and
trigger panic alarm using HTTP GET request.

    BASE_URL/armaway  - Arms Smart Alarm in Away node
    BASE_URL/armstay  - Arms Smart Alarm in Stay mode
    BASE_URL/disarm   - Disarms SmartAlarm
    BASE_URL/panic    - Triggers panic alarm
    BASE_URL/status   - Returns current status

The *BASE_URL* is https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations/APP_ID,
where APP_ID is the installed Smart App ID.

Please note that the REST API is disable by default. You can enable it using
Smart Alarm *REST API Options* menu. Before enabling the REST API, please make
sure that OAuth is enabled in the smart app settings in the IDE.

The REST API requires Access Token. You can obtain the access token using
SmartThings OAuth2 work flow, however as a convenience, Smart Alarm creates
the token for you. You can find your app's base URL and access token in the
SmartThings IDE.

Go to [My Locations](https://graph.api.smartthings.com/location/list) and
click on the "smartapps" link for your Location. Then find "Smart Alarm" in
the list of Installed SmartApps. Right-click on the "Smart Alarm" and select
"Open Link in New Window". Scroll down to the "Application State" section.
There you'll see "accessToken" and "url". Save those values and plug them in
into your web app.

### Installation

As of July 2015, Smart Alarm has been officially accepted by SmartThings and
is now available in the SmartThings Marketplace.

If you wish to install Smart Alarm from the GitHub repository, you will have
to self-publish it in the [SmartThings IDE](https://graph.api.smartthings.com).
Please refer to [SmartThings Developer Documentation](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/index.html)
for more information.
