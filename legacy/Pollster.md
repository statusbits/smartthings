Pollster
--------

**Please note that frequent polling of some devices (particularly Zigbee and
Z-Wave) may cause network congestion and lead to degraded system performance.
Therefore, polling rate faster than 5 minutes is not recommended. The author
of this software bears no responsibility for your system performance. Use it
at your own risk.**

----

Many [SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com) devices rely on frequent
polling to update their status periodically. These devices have 'polling'
capability and implement 'poll' command that the SmartThings polling engine
calls approximately every 10 minutes. The polling rate is not user-configurable
and may not be frequent enough for some devices. Also, the SmartThings polling
engine has been known to have bad days now and then, when it works
intermittently or stops working for hours or even days.

Here comes Pollster to the rescue! Pollster works behind the scenes and
periodically calls 'poll' or 'refresh' command for selected devices. Devices
can be arranged into four groups with independently configurable polling
intervals. The polling interval can be as short as one minute.
